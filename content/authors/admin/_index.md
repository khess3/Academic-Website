I am a Ph.D Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University. My research interests lie in the field of comparative politics and focus on the political economy of authoritarian regimes. In particular, I study business-state relations, corruption, and the rule of law with a geographic focus on Russia and the former Soviet Union. Methodologically, I am interested in using quasi-experimental methods to better understand these topics.

My dissertation explores judicial behavior in the Russian commercial courts, examining the process of judicial selection and its consequences for judicial decision-making and judicial evaluation. In my job market paper, I develop a theory of judicial selection where I argue that autocrats are more likely to appoint loyal candidates who can be relied on to rule cases in favor of the state. I further maintain that whether a candidate is considered to be loyal is dependent on their susceptibility to political pressure, with judges who have career histories in the public sector (e.g., court apparatus, prosecutor’s office, or investigative services) being especially vulnerable due to their lack of employment options outside of the state. To test this theory, I use original data on the career paths of judges and a sample of more than 200,000 court cases over the last decade. For my identification strategy, I exploit the random assignment of cases to judges, which allows me to ensure that there are no significant differences in case characteristics that could potentially impact judges’ decisions. Based on preliminary evidence, I find that judges with public sector backgrounds are indeed more likely to rule in favor of the state. This project has been supported through research grants from the Carnegie Corporation of New York through the Harriman Institute at Columbia University, as well as the Hilton Center for Economic Prosperity and Individual Opportunity at Florida State University.
